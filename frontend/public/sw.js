/*
 * Workoutt service worker — makes the app installable and fully usable
 * offline. All data lives in IndexedDB (the service worker never touches
 * it); this only caches the static shell.
 *
 * Strategy:
 *  - navigations: network-first, falling back to the cached page (then /)
 *  - assets:      stale-while-revalidate
 *
 * Deliberately absent: an install-time crawl of the whole asset graph. The
 * build emits ~57 fingerprinted chunks, and fetching them in a burst gets
 * rate-limited by static hosts (503s) — which then hit the app's own lazy
 * imports, since they queue behind the same limit. The cache fills as you
 * browse instead.
 *
 * Bump CACHE_VERSION to invalidate everything after a breaking change.

// of these apps on one origin) a bare "delete every key that isn't mine" makes
// the apps evict each other's caches on every activation. Scoping deletion to
// this prefix keeps the version bump working — CACHE_VERSION is

// Dev-server module URLs: serving them stale breaks the app after code changes.
// (The worker shouldn't be registered in dev at all, but belt and braces.)

// API endpoints: once the client resolves its sync URL from BASE_URL these live
// under the app's own base — inside this worker's scope. A stale-while-
// revalidate /sync/pull hands the client a response it has already applied and
// reports success: silent data loss. And GET /backup would otherwise be served
// from cache too. Matched on pathname, so the query string (?since=) is
// irrelevant; the exact endpoints are anchored so a page route like /backups/
// is not caught, and /sync//push/ stay prefix-matched because the app prefix is
// not known here. The list is kept identical to readerr's even though workoutt
// has no /title or /dbsize — these two service workers are otherwise the same
// file, and the moment they diverge cosmetically nobody diffs them again.
